To make the layered coffee for a small cup we need 2 and a half spoon coffee in a glass. Then we need to add 1 spoon of water. Not too much water. If 1 spoon of water is too less then take just a bit more water. Then add 2 spoons of sugar or a bit more because the mixture will be very bitter. Then stir the mixture very well for atleast 15 to 20 minutes. Half an hour is the best. We have to stir it violently and fast. If there is a blender then the mixture will be very good and it will take very less time. After stirring, the mixture will be like foam. After that in a cup we have to make normal coffee and pour the foam on the coffee. If the foam dissolves in the coffee then the foam was not stirred well. The most important thing is to add sugar in the foam.
